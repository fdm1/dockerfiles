This container is for use with [Coursera - Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home/welcome)

It is based on `openjdk:8-jdk`, and includes `sbt` (a requirement for the coursera course). The docker build also pre-builds the course's example scala environment.

The container also builds a version of `fdm1/base_dev` to install vim/tmux/etc to make this a fully working dev environment.
